#DumbSophomores Catastrophe Client

If siggame is still hosting the server, join a match called MATCH_NAME with
```
./run Catastrophe -s game.siggame.io -r MATCH_NAME
```
Else, you will need to run [Cadre, siggameâ€™s server,](https://github.com/siggame/Cadre/blob/master/howToPlay.md) locally. 
If you get that to work, you can run this client in a match named MATCH_NAME with
```
./run catastrophe -r MATCH_NAME
```
since the server defaults to localhost.

DumbSophomores used Python3 for Catastrophe.
